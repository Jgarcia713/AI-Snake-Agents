# ISTA 450 Final Project -- AI Snake Agents  

This project implements 3 main AI agents to play the game Snake (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre))  
Each agent features a different algorithm--A* search and reinforcement learning methods such as Q-learning and approximate Q-learning. 

Upon running `runGame.py` the console will display the simulation of the game, and you can see the progress of the snake and the moves it takes to reach the fruit.  
As a constant at the top of the file, you can change the size of the grid that the snake lives in. Due note that larger grid sizes will cause the reinforcment learning agents to require more time to train, and will likely require you adding more training rounds as well.
